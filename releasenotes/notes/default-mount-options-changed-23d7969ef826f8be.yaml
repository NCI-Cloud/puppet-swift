    The nobarrier XFS mount option is removed from kernel 4.19.0 and beyond.
    It has no effect on kernel 4.10.0. Therefore, it is now removed from the
    default mount options.
    Also, puppet-swift now adds the nofail option, so that a swift store node
    finishes to boot even if an HDD mount is failed.
